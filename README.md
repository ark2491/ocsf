This repository is the starting point for Splunk TA's that compliment the OCSF Schema.

1. TA-linux-auditd-oscf
  - To perform testing, I actually changed the sourcetype name to differentiate it from other logs on my at home splunk. This does not have to be permanent.
  - Current Version 1.0.1 ties to OCSF class_uid [2001, 3001, 3002, 3003](https://schema.ocsf.io/), with more to be integrated (system activity next)
